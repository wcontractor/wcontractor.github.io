    "[Harvard CS109](http://cs109.github.io/2015/) is a great course to learn more about Data Science the supporting methods of data engineering, data analysis, data visualization.  Taking this course not only broadens your knowledge of Python, but teaches you good patterns for implementing the tools and solving real world problems.  I would **highly** recommend this one.  The lectures and labs are available online from Harvard, but the homeworks were only posted for the 2013 course. \n",

    ">This course introduces methods for five key facets of an investigation: data wrangling, cleaning, and sampling to get a suitable data set; data management to be able to access big data quickly and reliably; exploratory data analysis to generate hypotheses and intuition; prediction based on statistical methods such as regression and classification; and communication of results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries."

    "This Coursera course is touch by Dr. Charles Severance from the University of Michigan and is based on the book Python for Informatics.  This is a great place to start your journey in Python.  The course covers the basics from syntax and data dtypes to conditionals.  If you are new to programming or Python I would **highly** recommend starting here.  Ther are some data types like tuples and patterns like how to iterate over a dictionary that you can use over and over again in your journey.  This course also covers some advanced topics like how to work with an API and write data to a SQLite database.\n",

You should have a firm grasp of working with data, cleaning data, and processing data prior to taking this.  The best part of this course were the latter weeks where the statistical concepts where introduced.  Using Python and Pandas to summarize the data and perform more complex operations like t-tests. \n",

# Background
This is my **first** blog post using pelican. I setup my github pages site sometime ago and after the first post I quickly realized that I needed a more robust management tool.  Sometime ago I ran a Wordpress site and missed the capabilities offered such as categories and plugins and of course themes.  I did some googling and quickly found that there are 2 major ways that people are managing personal blogs using gh-pages, Jekyll and Pelican.  For me, the decision was easy.  I'm a Pythonist in the making and since Pelican utilizes Python I went with it.

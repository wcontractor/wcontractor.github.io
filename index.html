<p> I work in IT, but am not a developer by trade. I have spent the majority of my working career at large Financial Services and P & C Insurance Companies.  Working in teams and managing large projects I have managed to avoid coding my entire working career.  I have taken some development classes in college, C++ and Java.  However, the cirriculum was based around data structures and algorithms and I never really understood the practical application.
  Why would I possibly want to reverse a string or create a fibbonicci sequence?  The core concepts never clicked with me because I didn't enjoy it.  Looking back at it now, I understand the value of learning algorithms and knowing how to break down a problem into small pieces helps to teach someone how to think, but I'm not sure C++ and Java were the best languages for me to start with.  The learning curve was too steep, the rigidness of the object oriented
  languages was too difficult for me to grasp, and it was never really any fun.

<p>A few months ago, as of writing this page, I sat down and started to learn Python. When I say learn I mean, really read about it, understand it, and write code.  I always enjoy learning new things, but the uses and application of Python from task automation, to data analysis, and building dynamic websites have really kept me interested.
  I was first hooked by <a href="http://www.py4inf.com/"> Python for Informatics: Exploring Infomration.</a>  Dr. Charles Severance's book and Coursera Course made learning the language enjoyable.
  After completing both I'm still really into learning Python and have since moved onto Think. <a href="http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/">Think Python 2e</a>, <a href="http://cs109.github.io/2015/index.html"> CS109 Data Science - Harvard</a>,
  and Python for Data Analysis to plunge into Pandas </p>

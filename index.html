<p> I work in IT, but am not a developer by trade. I have spent the majority of my working career at large Financial Services and P & C Insurance Companies.  Working in teams and managing large projects I have managed to avoid coding my entire working career.  I have taken some development classes previously, C++ and Java.  However, those courses were based around data structures and algorithms and I never really understood the practical application.
  Why would I possibly want to reverse a string or create a fibbonicci sequence?  The core concepts never clicked with me because I didn't enjoy it.  Looking back at it now, I understand the value of learning algorithms and knowing how to break down a problem into small pieces helps to teach someone how to think, but I'm not sure C++ and Java were the best languages for me to start with.

<p>A few months ago I sat down and started to learn Python, really read about it, understand it, and write code.  I always enjoy learning new things, but the uses and application of Python from task automation, to data analysis, and building dynamic websites have really kept me interested.  So based on my oldest repository commit date it has been about 4 months now and I'm still really into learning Python.</p>

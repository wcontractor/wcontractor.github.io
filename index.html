</span></a>Background</h3>
<p> One of my new year's resolutions was to write more. I don't consider myself a writer, but I do enjoy blogging.  The process of writing and creating blog posts helps to organize my thoughts and provides a sense of accomplishment when completing a post. There is a also some creativity in the design process of creating a post - the structure, the outline, the flow of the content.
  That process combined with my firend Justin's blog <a href="https://www.livelodo.com/">Live LODO</a> inspired me to put these pages together.

  I have spent the majority of my working career at large Financial Services and Property and Casualty (P&C) Insurance Companies where I assemble teams and managing large projects. I understand the development process, and can apply different techniques to manage it, but am not responsible for delivering code.
  I have taken development classes in college, C++ and Java.  However, the cirriculum was based around data structures and algorithms and I never really understood the practical application.
  Why would I possibly want to reverse a string or create a fibbonicci sequence?  The core concepts never clicked with me because I didn't enjoy it.  Looking back at it now, I understand the value of learning algorithms and knowing how to break down a problem into small pieces helps to teach someone how to think, but I'm not sure C++ and Java were the best languages for me to start with.
  These staticly typed langues have a steep learning curve,  and it was never really any fun for me.

<p>A few months ago, as of writing this page, I sat down and started to learn Python. When I say learn I mean, really read about it, understand it, and write code.  I always enjoy learning new things, but the uses and application of Python from task automation, to data analysis, and building dynamic websites have really kept me interested.
  I was first hooked by <a href="http://www.py4inf.com/"> Python for Informatics: Exploring Infomration.</a>  Dr. Charles Severance's book and Coursera Course made learning the language enjoyable.
  After completing both I'm still really enjoying learning Python and have since moved onto <a href="http://cs109.github.io/2015/index.html"> CS109 Data Science - Harvard</a>
  and <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do"> Wes McKinney's book Python for Data Analysis </a> to plunge into Pandas </p>
